# installROSXavier
Install Robot Operating System (ROS) on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier

These scripts will install Robot Operating System (ROS) on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit.

For L4T 31.0.2 (JetPack 4.1)


The script is based on the Ubuntu ARM install of ROS Melodic: http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu

Maintainer of ARM builds for ROS is http://answers.ros.org/users/1034/ahendrix/

There are two scripts:

<strong>installROS.sh</strong>
<pre>
Usage: ./installROS.sh  [[-p package] | [-h]]
 -p | --package &lt;packagename&gt;  ROS package to install
                               Multiple Usage allowed
                               The first package should be a base package. One of the following:
                                 ros-melodic-ros-base
                                 ros-melodic-desktop
                                 ros-melodic-desktop-full
 </pre>
 
Default is ros-melodic-ros-base if no packages are specified.

Example Usage:

$ ./installROS.sh -p ros-melodic-desktop -p ros-melodic-rgbd-launch

This script installs a baseline ROS environment. There are several tasks:

<ul>
<li>Enable repositories universe, multiverse, and restricted</li>
<li>Adds the ROS sources list</li>
<li>Sets the needed keys</li>
<li>Loads specified ROS packages, defaults to ros-melodic-base-ros if none specified</li>
<li>Initializes rosdep</li>
</ul>

You can edit this file to add the ROS packages for your application. 

<strong>setupCatkinWorkspace.sh</strong>
Usage:

$ ./setupCatkinWorkspace.sh [optionalWorkspaceName]

where optionalWorkspaceName is the name of the workspace to be used. The default workspace name is catkin_ws. This script also sets up some ROS environment variables. Refer to the script for details.

<em><b>Note:</b> On June 7, 2019 the GPG key for ROS was changed due to security issues. If you have ROS installed on your system before this, you should delete the GPG key:</em>
 
<pre>
$ sudo apt-key del 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
</pre>
